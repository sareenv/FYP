This is a discussion based chapter BLAH BLAH BLAH ....
Your first supervisor may have a very good idea of how well you tackled your project - however second supervisors may not have any idea.  For this reason you need to include an account of the conduct of the project. What problems you encountered, how you overcame them, how diligently you worked, how you sought advice, how you responded to feedback. This chapter will be evidence driven â€“ which is why you need to keep a log or diary of your project, maybe a project management timeline with milestones, keep evidence of each supervision meeting (signed off by your supervisor), Keep notes of supervisor feedback to your presentation and reflect on them in this chapter.
