The research purposes a solution based on deep convolutional neural networks with various experiments mentioned in further sections.
The operations require machine learning specific configuration for Cuda libraries and configuration to run programs on available GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) for faster processing and further, 
instructions to setup environment can be found at \url{https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu}. In addition, convolutional neural network was implmented using Python3 and jupyter notebooks were used in these experiments 
which provides an appropriate interface to experiment and write markdowns.
The data science and machine learning libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations, matplotlib for visualisation, Keras for developing deep learning models and OpenCV for image processing was used in the process of developing an automated system for classifying pigmented skin lesions.
HAM,1000 dataset was used to train image classifier, which can be found at
\url{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T}. The dataset contains two folders containing dermatoscopic images of pigmented skin lesion and CSV file which contains meta information and image name for each pigmented skin lesion.
