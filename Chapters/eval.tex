In this chapter, you should evaluate what you have done, and say what answer (to your research question) you have arrived at. It may be that in your method you describe some experiments, and this section records your results and analysis of those results. This is an important section -- most students gain or lose marks in either their literature review or evaluation. The key to producing a convincing evaluation is to plan very early in the project what information or results you will need to write this section.
