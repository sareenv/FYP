The most common conventional diagnosis method of detection involves
using ABCD rule which considers the Asymmetry, Border irregularity,
Colour irregularities and  Dermoscopic structures respectively of the
common pigmented skin lesions \citep{LOESCHER2013170}. 
The rule for classification was introduced in 1985 as abcd 
rule and was amended with abcde in 2004 where ‘E’ reflects the 
lesions which are evolving. An alternative method of examination of
pigmented skin lesions is  ugly duckling signs which was introduced 
to state the limitation of the ABCD rule \citep{DanielJensen2015}.
The ugly duckling signs state the spot which is unlike other 
lesions are great suspects of melanoma \citep{grob1998ugly}.
Despite the limitations of above methods, both provide a great
framework for clinicians and general audiences to spot melanoma 
based symptoms \citep{DanielJensen2015}.
Small malignant melanoma are millimeters in size in initial phases
of its growth.

The micro-melanoma requires more attention to be
detected by physicians and researchers believe that small 
lesions possess challenges for medical professionals to 
clearly examine malignant based problems \citep{doi:10.1177/030089160409000125}.
Dermatoscopy is non-invasive microscopic imaging of pigmented skin 
lesions which provides clear imaging to perform proper analysis on 
pigmented skin lesions \citep{LOESCHER2013170}. 
The study was conducted in Italy for the period of five years in 
which ninety four melanoma based lesions. Furthermore, results 
were treated to examine the clinical and dermoscopic features of 
cutaneous melanoma lesions with maximum diameter of 3mm. 
The outcome of the research has shown that only samples of twenty two lesions which 
accounts for 2.4 percent of overall samples were decided based on
the clinical size feature of pigmented skin lesions \citep{doi:10.1177/030089160409000125}.
Moreover, the research mentions that dermoscopic results are more accurate to diagnose 
and has been an aid for early detection of melanoma skin cancer 
provided the clinicians are aware about disease \citep{doi:10.1177/030089160409000125}.
The result of dermatoscopic images is examined by dermatologists to classify the pigmented skin lesion.
Dermatologists select different approaches to examine pigmented
skin lesions which might include ABCDE rule or ugly duckling signs, 
where both the methods complement each other to detect pigmented skin lesions. 
The research proposed an addition of ‘F’ to mnemonic which uses both 
current methods ugly duckling sign and ABCDE rule which also account 
for funny or unlike lesions to be suspect of melanoma based lesion \citep{doi:10.1177/030089160409000125}.
