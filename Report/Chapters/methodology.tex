\section{Conceptual Modelling}
The Conceptual models of the overall system was developed using workflow 
and UML(unified modelling language) diagrams to design and conceptualise
the structural and behavioural requirments of the system. The conceptual designs 
helps to build the design of the overall components system.

\section{Experiments with Hyperparameters}
The experiments were performed on the convolutional model to understand the effects of the hyper-parameters 
such as learning rate of the network, the number of epochs for which the model for trained and increasing the hidden  
and convolutional layers. The adjustments to the hyperparameters which were made on the model had an impact on the accuracy of the overall classification of the pigmented skin lesions.
