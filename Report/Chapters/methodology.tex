\section{Experiments with Hyperparameters}
The experiments were performed on the convolutional model to understand the effects of the hyper-parameters 
such as learning rate of the network, the number of epochs for which the model for trained and increasing the hidden  
and convolutional layers. The adjustments to the hyperparameters which were made on the model had an impact on the accuracy of the overall classification of the pigmented skin lesions.

The model training was performed using the segmented images of pigmented skin lesions as mentioned in the 
image processing section. The model with same architecture was trained under thirty epochs using SGD optimiser. The experiment performed above resulted in 74.0\% model 
accuracy on testing data. The figure \ref{fig:segmodel} shows the increase in accuracy rate of training and 
validation data and decline in the loss function.
