\section{Experiments with Hyperparameters}
The experiments were performed on the convolutional model to understand the effects of the hyper-parameters 
such as learning rate of the network, the number of epochs for which the model for trained and increasing the hidden  
and convolutional layers. The adjustments to the hyperparameters which were made on the model had an impact on the accuracy of the overall classification of the pigmented skin lesions.

The model training was performed using the segmented images of pigmented skin lesions as mentioned in the 
image processing section. The model with same architecture was trained under thirty epochs using SGD optimiser. The experiment performed above resulted in 74.0\% model 
accuracy on testing data. The figure \ref{fig:segmodel} shows the increase in accuracy rate of training and 
validation data and decline in the loss function.

\section{Developing Web System}

The model with the best accuracy trained in keras was converted and loaded into the
tensforflowjs web framework. Furthermore, the website was developed using HTML5, CSS3, 
Bootstrap and Javascript to get the file uploaded by the client and intract with the 
model deployed on the node js server which also serves the static contents of the website.
The website displays the user with the classification of pigmented skin lesions with most 
percentage among all the other categories of pigmented skin lesions. The web system was developed as 
the proof of concept and can further be developed to book appoitments with medical 
professionals.
