Abstract should be a succinct and self-standing summary of the basis, context and achievements of the project. Minimally an abstract does three things: (1) It states the problem that you set out to solve, (2) It describes your solution and method, (3) It states a conclusion about the success of the solution. Be straightforward and factual and avoid vague statements, confusing details and "hype". Do not be tempted to use acronyms or jargon to keep within the half-page limit. Consider that search engines, librarians and non-computer scientists wishing to classify your Report rely on the abstract. You may if you wish provide a short list of keywords (2-6 is reasonable) at the end of the abstract.
