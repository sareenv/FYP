Based on the progress perfoma report and online review of the research project through Microsoft Teams software the 
following feedback was given by the project supervisor.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Testing and Evaluation Section
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Confusion matrix also known error matrix was appropriate based on the feed back to compare the 
        results of automated system and medical professionals.
        \item The t-tests were recommended by the supervisor for the evaluation of significance of the 
        obtained results.
        \item It was advised to get further guidance on conducting the appropriate stastically testing from Sigma maths 
        support center for the evaluation of the results.
        \item As, a result independent t-test was peformed for the stastically significant result obtained 
        from evaluation with the support of maths support center using SPSS software.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Including model accuracy for each experiments.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The methodology section was missing the accuracy results obtained from the different model experiments.
        \item As, a result all the accuracy tables were added to the experiments.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Refrancing and Formatting.
    \item \begin{itemize}
        \item Based on the feedback from the supervisor the referancing mentioned in the report was in correct format.
        \item It was advised that relevant links should be included in the footer of the document to 
        provide clear reading experience.
        \item As, a result all the relevant urls were shifted to the footer using footnote command in latex.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Development Lifecycle}
The waterfall software development lifecycle was used during developing the project. The waterfall
model also known as linear-sequential life cycle model focuses on completing each phase of
development before switching to the next stage of development Cite{1}.

The waterfall model was accurate for this project as the scope of the project is small and was developed individually. Output
from each phase of development lifecycle acts as the input to the next phase. The figure above
\ref{fig:waterfall} shows the various phases of the waterfall development lifecycle. In initial phase of the
development the requirements and targeted audience were analysed as mentioned in the
introduction section of the project. The second phase involved developing conceptual models using
UML(Unified Modelling Language) to design the system using component diagram which captures
the structural and sequence diagram to capture the behavioural design of the system. The next
phase of waterfall model was implementation of the intelligent system to detect pigmented skin
lesions. The implementation phase of the lifecycle involved developing convolutional network and
performing various experiments to get optimal performance. Furthermore, The next phase of
development was to test the effectiveness of the overall system for which the prediction results
gathered from medical professionals in the form of questionnaires were compared with the
automated system and results were analysed with confusion matrix. The last phase was to deploy
the model to the web-based system which was done by converting the keras model to json file and
using tensorflowjs. At last, the maintenance phase of lifecycle cannot be applied to short term
project.
