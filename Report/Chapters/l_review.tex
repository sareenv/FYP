\end{figure}
In 1998, the lenet-5 the model architecture was purposed by Yann Lecun in an attempt to recognise handwritten images of mathematical digits.
The figure \ref{figure:lenetarc} shows the lenet-5 model architecture, the model only consists of seven overall layers and two layers are convolutional to extract the feature maps from given 32 * 32 pixel of the image \citep{lecun1998gradient}. 
Lenet architecture focuses on applying the 5 * 5 convolution to extract 6 feature maps of size 28 * 28 pixels. Furthermore, sub-sampling is performed on the feature maps using the average pooling algorithm and contains the 6 feature maps of size 14 * 14 followed by a convolutional layer of 16 feature maps of size 10 * 10 \citep{lecun1998gradient}. 
Further process of downsampling is performed on feature maps using average pooling and processed through a fully connected neural network. 
The model was used in the banks to detect handwritten digits on the documents. 
The lenet architecture was one of the earliest convolutional network to perform the automation in banking 
sector. The research project will focus on using the lenet convolutional model architecture on detecting 
the pigmented skin lesion to investigate it's performance.

\subsection{Border Detection Based System}
Rahil Garnavi and his other co-researchers purposed research based on a state of the art border detection method combined with the colour space analysis and clustering-based histogram hybrid thresholding 
to classify pigmented skin lesions. The research was primarily focused on the research was to develop the hair removal mechanism to perform colour channels transformation. Furthermore, for all the image channels the noise reduction 
and clustering-based histogram thresholding were performed for optimal border detection. The predicted outcomes of novel border detection system were compared with the 
borders detected by the actual dermatologists on a sample of 
dermoscopic pigmented skin lesions to understand the reliability of the 
system \citep{GARNAVI2011105}.However, the system was only tested on a data sample set of 
30 dermoscopic images and four sample sets of dermatologist hand-drawn images were used as ground
truth to compare the results. The system was tested on overall 85 dermoscopic pigmented skin images 
with high resolution. Border detection can be used to analyse the pigmented skin lesions but 
convolutional networks have the potential to find more data patterns in the images to minimise 
the cost function using the backpropagation algorithm. The current research will employe basic image
segmentation based on the binary threshold algorithm as an experiment to help network detecting more accurate
borders of pigmented skin lesions.

\subsection{Deep Feature to classify Pigmented Skin lesions}
In 2016, a research paper from Simon Fraser Universityâ€™s computer science and medical image analysis lab had researched using 
deep residual network architecture with ten labelled 
classes of pigmented skin lesions. The research was based on very 
deep convolutional network architecture with the accuracy 
of 85.8 percent in classifying five distinct classes and
81 percent in classifying 10 classes of pigmented skin lesions
\citep{7493528}. Although the performance of the overall convolutional network was accurate, the training and testing data were limited to 13,00 overall images of 10 distinct classes.
However, In the current research project, the classes of labelled images will be five and around 9,000 overall images will be used during the investigation.
Estimated 80 percent of data will be consumed for training the model, and the rest of the label images will be used as validation and testing datasets 
to evaluate the performance of the model. Research is also consuming such artificial neural network-based technologies to various areas of investigations.
