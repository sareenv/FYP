The image above represents the biological structure of the neuron which includes three major parts of a neuron dendrite, nucleus and axon terminals.
The dendrites are accountable for accepting the incoming signals from other neurons. 
Moreover, nucleus of the neuron is responsible for processing the information. 
Furthermore, the processed information gets passed to other neuron or organs through axon terminals 
in the human body \citep{AGATONOVICKUSTRIN2000717}.
