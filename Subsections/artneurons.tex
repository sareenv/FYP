Preceptron model was proposed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1943 to design the model to 
mimic the human brain \citep{939589}. Preceptron model or single layered feed forwards network 
networks takes the vectors of inputs and multiply with a randomly 
initialised weights and add random bias to network and process the information by providing data to the
activation function to process the information \citep{AGATONOVICKUSTRIN2000717}.
Figure above represents the simple preceptron model which consists inputs x and weights w 
for which weighted sum of muliplication result of 
inputs and weights will be passed to step activation function.

\subsection{Mathematical Representation }
\vspace{3mm}
{The equation below represents the preceptron model mentioned above in Mathematical notations.}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        y = \Big[\sigma(\sum_{k=0}^n x_k.w_k + b_k)\Big] \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

     {
        In, euation above ${\sigma = Activation function}$, x and w represents the inputs provided 
        and weights vectors in the network respectively. Furthermore symbol b represents the  bias in the equation, 
        during the optimisation of the network weights and bias are adjusted accordingly to improve the 
        predection. There are various activation functions ${\sigma}$ such as  step function sigmoid, 
        relu, leaky relu and others that can be applied based on the requirments of model prediction.
