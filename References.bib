abstract = "Objective
Computerized analysis of pigmented skin lesions (PSLs) is an active area of research that dates back over 25years. One of its main goals is to develop reliable automatic instruments for recognizing skin cancer from images acquired in vivo. This paper presents a review of this research applied to microscopic (dermoscopic) and macroscopic (clinical) images of PSLs. The review aims to: (1) provide an extensive introduction to and clarify ambiguities in the terminology used in the literature and (2) categorize and group together relevant references so as to simplify literature searches on a specific sub-topic.
Methods and material
The existing literature was classified according to the nature of publication (clinical or computer vision articles) and differentiating between individual and multiple PSL image analysis. We also emphasize the importance of the difference in content between dermoscopic and clinical images.
Results
Various approaches for implementing PSL computer-aided diagnosis systems and their standard workflow components are reviewed and summary tables provided. An extended categorization of PSL feature descriptors is also proposed, associating them with the specific methods for diagnosing melanoma, separating images of the two modalities and discriminating references according to our classification of the literature.
Conclusions
There is a large discrepancy in the number of articles published on individual and multiple PSL image analysis and a scarcity of reported material on the automation of lesion change detection. At present, computer-aided diagnosis systems based on individual PSL image analysis cannot yet be used to provide the best diagnostic results. Furthermore, the absence of benchmark datasets for standardized algorithm evaluation is a barrier to a more dynamic development of this research area."

abstract = "In this paper a methodological approach to the classification of pigmented skin lesions in dermoscopy images is presented. First, automatic border detection is performed to separate the lesion from the background skin. Shape features are then extracted from this border. For the extraction of color and texture related features, the image is divided into various clinically significant regions using the Euclidean distance transform. This feature data is fed into an optimization framework, which ranks the features using various feature selection algorithms and determines the optimal feature subset size according to the area under the ROC curve measure obtained from support vector machine classification. The issue of class imbalance is addressed using various sampling strategies, and the classifier generalization error is estimated using Monte Carlo cross validation. Experiments on a set of 564 images yielded a specificity of 92.34% and a sensitivity of 93.33%."

Conclusion
Early detection of skin cancer through established methods or newer technologies is critical for reducing both skin cancer mortality and the overall skin cancer burden.
Implications for Nursing Practice
A basic knowledge of recommended skin examination guidelines and risk factors for skin cancer, traditional methods to further examine lesions that are suspicious for skin cancer and evolving detection technologies can guide patient education and skin inspection decisions."

abstract = "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are biologically inspired computer programs designed to simulate the way in which the human brain processes information. ANNs gather their knowledge by detecting the patterns and relationships in data and learn (or are trained) through experience, not from programming. An ANN is formed from hundreds of single units, artificial neurons or processing elements (PE), connected with coefficients (weights), which constitute the neural structure and are organised in layers. The power of neural computations comes from connecting neurons in a network. Each PE has weighted inputs, transfer function and one output. The behavior of a neural network is determined by the transfer functions of its neurons, by the learning rule, and by the architecture itself. The weights are the adjustable parameters and, in that sense, a neural network is a parameterized system. The weighed sum of the inputs constitutes the activation of the neuron. The activation signal is passed through transfer function to produce a single output of the neuron. Transfer function introduces non-linearity to the network. During training, the inter-unit connections are optimized until the error in predictions is minimized and the network reaches the specified level of accuracy. Once the network is trained and tested it can be given new input information to predict the output. Many types of neural networks have been designed already and new ones are invented every week but all can be described by the transfer functions of their neurons, by the learning rule, and by the connection formula. ANN represents a promising modeling technique, especially for data sets having non-linear relationships which are frequently encountered in pharmaceutical processes. In terms of model specification, artificial neural networks require no knowledge of the data source but, since they often contain many weights that must be estimated, they require large training sets. In addition, ANNs can combine and incorporate both literature-based and experimental data to solve problems. The various applications of ANNs can be summarised into classification or pattern recognition, prediction and modeling. Supervised associating networks can be applied in pharmaceutical fields as an alternative to conventional response surface methodology. Unsupervised feature-extracting networks represent an alternative to principal component analysis. Non-adaptive unsupervised networks are able to reconstruct their patterns when presented with noisy samples and can be used for image recognition. The potential applications of ANN methodology in the pharmaceutical sciences range from interpretation of analytical data, drug and dosage form design through biopharmacy to clinical pharmacy."

abstract = "Automated border detection is one of the most important steps in dermoscopy image analysis. Although numerous border detection methods have been developed, few studies have focused on determining the optimal color channels for border detection in dermoscopy images. This paper proposes an automatic border detection method which determines the optimal color channels and performs hybrid thresholding to detect the lesion borders. The color optimization process is tested on a set of 30 dermoscopy images with four sets of dermatologist-drawn borders used as the ground truth. The hybrid border detection method is tested on a set of 85 dermoscopy images with two sets of ground truth using various metrics including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and border error. The proposed method, which is comprised of two stages, is designed to increase specificity in the first stage and sensitivity in the second stage. It is shown to be highly competitive with three state-of-the-art border detection methods and potentially faster, since it mainly involves scalar processing as opposed to vector processing performed in the other methods. Furthermore, it is shown that our method is as good as, and in some cases more effective than a dermatology registrar."

abstract = { Background and aimsVery small pigmented lesions may represent an extreme diagnostic challenge to the clinician. Our aim was to describe the clinical and dermoscopic features in a series of cutaneous melanomas with a maximum clinical diameter of 3 mm.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study of the 924 primary melanomas seen and treated during a period of five years at the Unit for Melanoma Detection of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan, Italy. The size characteristics of the considered lesions allowed the identification of 22 (2.4\%) cases of micro-melanoma (clinical diameter of 3 mm or less). Sixteen of these cases were subjected to dermoscopy. The clinical and dermoscopic features as well as the corresponding diagnoses were recorded.ResultsThe typical lesion presents as a small, dark, often black macule, generally evenly colored, with well-defined borders; it may be asymmetric or symmetric in shape. These features prompted a correct clinical diagnosis in nearly half of the cases. Dermoscopy lead to a correct diagnosis in all cases subjected to the technique.ConclusionDermoscopy appears to be an efficient aid to the diagnosis of micro-melanomas, provided that clinicians are aware of this type of lesion and maintain the index of suspicion at a high level. }
